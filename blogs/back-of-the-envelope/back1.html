        <p>The Ghawar oil field in Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest oil field, having produced about 70 bn barrels of oil so far and still having capacity for 50 bn barrels of oil. To put this into context, the world consumes 1 bn barrels of oil every 10 days (so, if all the oil in the world was coming from Saudi, it would get over in 500 days). 
The US is the world’s largest oil producer, closely followed by both Saudi and Russia. The discovery of fracking in Texas especially changed the geopolitical dynamics between the US and Saudi, since it allowed the US to leapfrog Saudi as the world’s largest producer of oil. 
Though the appeal of Saudi, and the reason why they are the ‘producers of last resort’ is because of the relative ease in which they can shift through gears. This can formally be measured through what is called Energy-Return-on-Investment (EROI) which shows how many barrels of oil you get as output for every barrel that goes in as input. During the early days of oil exploration, we used to get 100-to-1 while these days we only get 5-to-1. The problem is more pronounced when it comes to the US where EROI is far lower. 
Another reason why Saudi oil is preferred is because it is lightweight and has less sulphur content. This reduces the number of steps needed in refining it before it is rendered usable. Heavy, sulphuric oils are generally found in places like Venezuela, Mexico and Canada - so yeah, all oil producers are not the same; quality matters.
Interesting tangent - much of the oil refineries in the US were set up to refine heavy, sulphuric oil coming from Venezuela, Mexico and Canada. This is true because the shale oil/ fracking revolution in the US was a fairly recent phenomenon. So while the US is the largest producer of oil globally, it itself produces lightweight, low-sulphur oil which it does not have the capacity to refine. So it ships off its domestic Texan crude to refineries in Europe and relies on imports of crude instead. 
Saudi’s dominance in oil may be on the decline because we are making an intermediate transition from oil to natural gas before we make a permanent transition from oil to renewables. The discovery of the North Field in Qatar is massive - it is the world’s largest natural gas field and supplies ~5% of the world’s energy currently. As the world continues to make this transition, it may rely more on the natural gas from Qatar than the crude oil from Saudi. 
Though it is useful to note that natural gas is harder to transport than crude oil. Oil can be shipped in barrels and transported via sea. Gas either needs to be moved via thousands of miles of pipelines or needs to be liquified into LNG before being filled into barrels. Either way there is at least one extra step there that adds to its cost. Though it does have the highest energy density among all available fuels currently. 
India has a demand of 5 mn barrels of oil per day (BPD), of which 4 mn barrels are imported, though all crude oil is refined within the country. The price of a barrel of oil is ~INR 5K. 
An important metric here is energy-to-chemical ratio, which measures what % of crude oil can be converted to non-petroleum chemicals. This matters because the chemicals derived from crude oil are actually more profitable than the fuel itself. Most refineries have energy-to-chemical ratios in the range of 10-15%, Reliance’s factory in Jamnagar operates at ~20%. </p>
