        <h2>Protectionism can be good in some instances</h2>
        <p>Protectionism is generally seen as outdated. Free trade and unrestricted movement across borders is supposed to be the norm to aspire towards. Yet, there are many instances where protectionism may actually work. Came across an interesting one today. </p>
        <p>India used to have >90% dependence on China for toys. The Indian govt then increased customs duty on Chinese toys from 30 to 60% and introduced quality standards effectively making it harder for the Chinese to compete. During this time Indian manufacturers like FunSkool thrived - opened up a state-of-the-art factory in Ranipet. Today, as part of a China+1 strategy, big retailers like Walmart and Target have started sourcing Indian toys from Funskool. Their Ranipet factory is apparently as good as a comparable factory in Vietnam.</p>
        <p>This shows that the "protectionism raises prices" response is not a one-size-fits-all. Toys are discretionary spending, we are okay if there is a slight price increase - mostly because its customers are those with disposable income. The gains we made through this protectionist measure are the jobs we generated in Ranipet.</p>
