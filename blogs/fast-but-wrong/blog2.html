        <h2>What the rise of the far-right tells us</h2>
        <p>Germany just had a snap election. This is because they had a 'traffic-light' coalition that did very little and received a vote of no confidence. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor from SPD, was too soft, inefficient and lacked any leadership.  </p>
        <p>In the Feb 2025 elections, the CDU/CSU won the largest share of votes. The far-right AfD got the second highest vote. What does this say about German politics - 
1. Germany is a multi-party system where coalitions are naturally built into the electoral process. The results of this election raise an interesting question on who the CDU/CSU will ally with.
	1. Germany has 2 votes - one for the local politician at your constituency level and the other for the party at the national level; every politician who wins at the local level is obviously part of the parliament. But if the party wins more/less share of the total parliamentary seats, the Bundestag expands through overhang and compensation seats, which allows more MPs to fill up the extra seats to make representation proportional. 
2. This election is a vindication of the rise of the right. The CDU/CSU itself is on the centre-right end of the spectrum. It wants to reduce govt spending, increase taxes, etc. (I think?)
3. The AfD won most of the seats in East Germany. This is a poorer, less developed part of Germany (which was under Soviet control) and is dominated by blue-collar workers. 
	1. German economy is slowing down, deindustrialising, losing jobs.
	2. Immigrant-linked crimes are rising </p>
